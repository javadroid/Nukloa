        <p class="words">
          The demand for storage systems has evolved from remote storage to instant cloud storage and, most recently,
          to blockchain-based decentralized storage, or NUKLEON, as we'll name it. Decentralized storage options are
          now required due to the growth of web3, which will eventually enable users to archive, retrieve, and
          maintain their own data. Storage nodes make up NUKLEON, which are used to hold data for other people. For
          distributing their storage and bandwidth, contributors receive payment. Client-side encryption and erasure
          coding are used to protect any data saved on Nukleon storage nodes. Developers can store information on the
          Nucleu Decentralized Orbital (NUD)using uplink clients, thanks to NUKLEON. When we need to spin up a new
          ETRON(S) and PTRON(S), i.e., information or collectibles, we can do it 90% faster while lowering network
          latency.

        <p class="words">
          Nukleon provides a substitute for centralized solutions for data storage and website availability. We are
          creating a network that functions like a SUPER-COMPUTER by combining the processing power and storage of
          numerous individual devices. This network can store multiple copies of data in the NUKLEUS/CORE.

        <p class="words">
          Examining the ecosystem and tools of the Nukleu decentralized orbital Project, one would understand that the
          Decentralized networks are not geographically constrained. The world's best brains are collaborating to
          advance the next iteration of the internet. Web3 platforms are gaining popularity since the promise of
          controlling and managing one's own data is revolutionary. Given that it is based on an incentive model,
          users are compensated for each time they store data on the NUD network.
